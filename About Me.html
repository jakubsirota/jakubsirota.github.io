    About Me

    My name is Jakub Sirota and in the following lines I would like to present me, my family and all the interesting things about my life.</p>
    <p>
    I grew up in the Czech Republic, where I was born in the December of 1998. My work experience is very various mostly because my dream is to be a big entrepreneur and I am very excited of trying and learning new things that will lead me to the path of a successful businessman.  I have gone through couple summertime jobs in my life, such as coaching little hockey players or working as laborer in my girlfriend’s father’s company, but the biggest experience I have had and still get would probably be my e-shop that has been working since Spring 2018 and growing day by day.

    I am a part of a middle-class family and have 12-year-old brother. My mother works as an accountant in a private business and my dad is currently doing a maintenance service at a public pool, receiving his salary along with the pension from the Czech Army, where he worked for 20 years. The living standards in the Czech Republic is probably 4 times lower than in the United States, which has been a huge challenge for me. If I did not receive a full scholarship, I would most likely not be attending university. It has been very hard for my parents to be funding even little things like books or flight tickets for me, which is a part of a reason, why I decided to start a business on my own. The option of studying at the university was given to me for a simple reason and that is a hockey.

        My life has been concentrated around ice hockey since I was 5 years old. My dad used to be an assistant coach for my team and was very hard at me, (What else could you expect from somebody, who is worked in army, right?) but I am more than happy that he was. When I turned 16 I was given an opportunity to become a part of a Czech National Team and from there my life has changed in a big way. I got to see a hockey world, travelling to Russia, USA, Canada, Switzerland or Finland and not only once. I got connections to hockey advisors and agents that set me on a track to become a student-athlete and that has been very crucial in the life-decisions I had to make. I left Czech Republic, when I was 17 to go play junior hockey, which is usually the best way to get a scholarship for a college. My first season in the USA was in the Cedar Rapids, Iowa and I was living with a family almost on the farm. This year was probably the hardest year of my life. I did not have any roommates, my coach was not a nicest person on the earth and I was diving into the injuries all the time. The reason of me mentioning this is that this year was the hardest, but definitely the most eye-opening year of my life so far. It taught me that nobody is waiting for me and that I have to work hard to earn my spot. I kept playing juniors another year and in the May 2018, I committed to the University of Maine for a Fall of 2019. In the October 2018, I received a call from my coach, telling that they lost a guy for a personal reason and that I will be coming to start one semester earlier and that is how I ended up here. Hockey has given me a big perspective for life, which I am very thankful of. The most important thing about me is actually not about me, but it is about somebody else.

    My girlfriend has been huge part of my life for two years and is my biggest motivation for success. She has been a huge support for me and we managed to get her a scholarship for the University of Maine as well. Although she has not received full scholarship, she still got a reasonable aid and will be coming for a fall of 2019 to study arts. Her dad has been a big role-model in my life and he is the man standing behind my businessman dream.
